				<h1>Willow (Rough Draft)</h1>
				<p>The load was heavy, but she was used to it. Living by herself had made Christa strong and independant, but sometimes she needed sustenance from the outside world. She liked to go to the general store as little as possible. The trip was long, there was always so much to get, and the house and animals had to be left alone while she was away. Too much time was always taken. Christa reflected on this. She didn’t have much else to do while walking, besides enjoying the evening woods’ beauty. Maybe it wouldn’t be so hard if I didn’t have as much to carry because I took more trips, she thought. But then it would take so much more planning. A delicate little sigh escaped and Christa let the bags drop with a heavy thund! She stopped and rubbed her arms, taking a small rest. She wasn’t winded but rather sore from chopping all that wood yesterday. </p>
				<p>It was still early fall and even warm tonight, but Christa didn’t want the winter to pounce. The dark memory of that one year shadowed her mind from the present. No, not being prepared for the snows was bad. She still had a lot to do before the end of the month. The basement needed to be cleaned, the blankets shaken out, sheets washed, comforters needed to be on the beds, the harvest was coming in… And now, with her tasks framed front and center in her mind, Christa felt grumpy. She sighed again, a lot heavier this time, and lifted the bags filled with canned foods and blankets and grain and broth and seed and pumpkins and matches and putty and wood. Immediately wanting to drop them again, Christa decided she needed to relax for a while. She had plenty of time to get home before dark. So she she started lugging the bags further along a small deer path that meandered through the tall brush. Her surroundings were made by quiet wooshes; that of her exhales from the load’s strain, that of her jeans against each other as she tottered with the bags, that of the tall grass against her jeans, that of the leaves against her flannel sleeves, that of the leaves under her feet, that of the wind in the leaves, that of the birds’ wings in the wind. The little wooshes were blissfully distracting from her toil. Soon the wooshes were layered under the sound of the creek. Turning aside from the tiny trail, Chirsta found her favorite spot to sit.</p>
				<p>It was a small meadow composed of short grass that was green this time of year and partly flooded with vivid auburns and ochres and scarlets from the fallen leaves. A few crusty survivors shook defying fists into the wind. The familiar rattling combined with the laughing brook told Christa she was there. Further into the meadow was a grove of willows. Most of them were big and bushy with narrow leaves, but closer to the water’s edge were weeping willow trees. Here and there sun-warmed boulders offered places to sit, and Christa took one’s invitation eagerly. Here she breathed deep the October air and let the rustling and chattering bring her outside her own worries, let the early evening sun gently wash the anxiousness away, let the willows’ leaves shelter her in peace. </p>
				<p>She sat on the warm boulder, leaning back against a weeping willow while its long, graceful, leafy vines slowly swished around her. There was so much to observe, from the evening sunlight slanting through the trees to the small gnats hovering to the clear bubbly waters of the creek playing. Christa kept her eyes closed, though, holding on the the familiar scene as she knew it and letting the rest of her senses fill in. She was most of all absorbed in thought. </p>
				<p>Simple thoughts, good thoughts, bad thoughts. Not about what she had to do tomorrow, or the day after that, or the day after that. No, Christa thought about her past and maybe what lay ahead in the future, and a little about how nice the present was. Most of the thoughts came like the fluffed cumulus clouds seen over the fall forest, floating in and forming slowly as images rather than words. Images of her past floated by. The good memories, like those warm, winter family fires and singing with her brothers were accompanied by the bad ones, like those sad, broken faces and hard goodbyes. I miss you, the girl thought. She felt vulnerable and sad. The wind rocked her back to comfort in accompaniment with the trees’ leaves’ lullaby, and Christa wondered if she would see her family again. The young woman suddenly wasn’t as sure or as passionate as she had previously been about living in nature’s embrace forever. Why do I always turn to more worries? Christa pondered.</p>
				<p>Christa did not want to go farther into that topic, as it was hard to think up and admit to any answers. She was saved from herself by a strange sound. I wonder what that is, she thought. It sounds like it’s more of an animal than the creek or the trees, she mused, trying to deduce the source of the noise. It was distorted from the other rustlings of the forest. After listening to the small hiccuping sounds for a while, Christa decided to search for it. Any hurt animal I’d take in, and any danger should be sought out, Christa thought. A slight hesitation at having to leave her bags did not stop her from eventually trusting no animal would find them and setting out along the creek’s edge.</p>
				<p>It was troublesome, trying to find the noises, because the mischievous brook seemed to be purposefully babbling all the louder to hide the delicate whimpers. But as Christa walked further, the noise became more distinct. Eventually Christa, scanning the far bank, came upon an unexpected sight. Across the white waters and maroon stones of the small stream was a thickly grained sand beach, and on that beach sat the distressed source of the cries. Christa could not believe her eyes, and so sat still and silent, watching for a while. On that beach, making those sobs…</p>
				<p>It was a small girl. Christa could not see the child’s face, for she was facing her directly and it was covered with her tiny hands, but she guessed that she might be six. The slight shoulders shook from the tears and were framed by frizzy white-blonde curls. Stunned by this discovery, Christa had no inkling of what action was to be taken. I don’t want to go over there and scare her, Christa reasoned, but I can’t just stand here. I have to do something, but what? I don’t know this girl. I don’t know how to take care of her. I’m only seventeen! </p>
				<p>The original calm drollness of the day was now replaced by boiling worry reflecting that of the waters of the river bubbling between the two. </p>
				<p>As the small child cried on, Christa was moved with pity. I have to do something, she thought. So Christa backtracked a little ways to a convenient series of stones spanning the stream, picked her way across, and started slowly toward the child’s beach. As she saw the girl again, Christa had to take a big breath of the October air for courage before she pushed on to meet the child. The leaf-covered forest floor prohibited a silent approach, and Christa cringed at every crunch. She reached the sobbing girl and squatted down to where she sat with her knees drawn up. Christa took in quickly her raggy, bunchy, dirty white shirt and torn up shorts. I wonder if she’s cold, Christa thought with a furrowed brow. </p>
				<p>“Hey,” she said. An olive branch, a lifeline extended, was that single word.</p>
				<p>The girl started and her round face shot up from her hands. Tear streaks formed little paths down a grimy face. Christa herself started. Looking into the girl’s gray-blue eyes showed Christa a reflection of not only herself, but also of her past.</p>
				<p class="slant">They had to go. It was final. They had to go. And they went. The old wood cabin was empty. There was no warmth in the hearth. There was no warmth in her heart. Christa sat alone against the wall in her attic room, knees drawn to her chest, face buried in her hands. Sobs shook her, pounding hiccups out as quick as the hot tears. The gasps came out, sounding like “Why? Why? Why?” and reflecting the young girl’s mood. Her family was gone. They were gone. </p>
				<p>Christa knew she did the right thing by approaching this girl. Christa knew how she felt, alone and crying. </p>
				<p>“Hey, are you okay?” Christa prodded gently again.</p>
				<p>The little girl was still crying, but the sobs, while still irregular, came gentler now. “No,” the girl spoke bluntly, shakily, through tears. Her small voice broke Christa’s heart.</p>
				<p>“Why are you crying?”</p>
				<p>“They’re gone.”</p>
				<p>If Christa’s heart was shattered before, now it was pulverized. “Hey, hey, shhh…” Christa spoke softly. “I’m here.”</p>
				<p>The girl gave a grumpy face and crossed her arms over her knees and placed her chin on it. Tears still ran down her cheeks.</p>
				<p>The girl gave a grumpy face and crossed her arms over her knees and placed her chin on it. Tears still ran down her cheeks.</p>
				<p>“I’m Christa,” she offered. “What’s your name.”</p>
				<p>The girl didn’t answer at first, rather just staring straight ahead at the weeping willows swaying in the breeze. Finally she again spoke frankly. “I don’t know.”</p>
